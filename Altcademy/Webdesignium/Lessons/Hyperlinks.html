<!-- A very useful element in HTML is the hyperlink or anchor tag. You use it to link to another file, page, or website.-->
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>
<!-- Anchor links are inline elements and you can nest them in other block or inline elements. If you have a paragraph and you want one of the phrases to link to somewhere else, enclose the phrase in an anchor link.-->
<p>
    If you are stuck, try <a href="http://www.google.com">googling</a> first.

<!-- You can use anchor links to enclose other elements, such as an image element <img>. So that when you click on the image, it will direct you to another page. We will look at the image element in later sections.-->
<a href="http://www.google.com">
    <img />
  </a>
<!--When you are in the progress of website development and you aren't sure where your links will link to yet, you can turn it into a dead link that doesn't point anywhere by using a '#' sign.-->
<a href="#">Dead link</a>
<!--Normally, anchor links open in the window tab you are currently browsing. We can make the anchor link open in a new window by adding the target attribute. Like so:-->
<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
